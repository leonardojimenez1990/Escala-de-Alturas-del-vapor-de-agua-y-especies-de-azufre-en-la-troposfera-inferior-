# Vertical scale for water vapor and sulfur compound profiles in the lower troposphere
In this research, it is proposed to use the vertical profiles of SO2 in order to obtain the concentration in the global troposphere in the period 2003-2020. To do this, the CAMS and ERA5 global reanalysis data will initially be processed in the 2003-2020 period and include multiple variables (specific humidity, sulfur dioxide, sulfate aerosol mixing ratio, SO2 precursor mixing ratio and height of boundary layer).  With the help of the linear regression method, the relationship between the concentration of pollutants SO2 and the vertical coordinate (pressure in isobaric coordinates) will be analyzed. in the troposphere in the period 2003-2020.
This Python 3.8 code processes the data from the CAMS Global Reanalysis (EAC4) monthly average fields to calculate the Vertical Scales for profiles of water vapor and sulfur compounds in the lower troposphere in the period 2003 - 2021.
